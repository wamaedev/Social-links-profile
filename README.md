## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

One of the main things I practiced in this challenge was using semantic HTML elements like <main>, <article>, <header>, and <nav> instead of relying only on <div>. I also reinforced how to style anchor tags as full-width buttons with hover and focus states.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Improve accessibility by paying closer attention to color contrast.
- Practice more responsive layouts without using fixed heights.
- Experiment with CSS Grid in addition to Flexbox.


### Useful resources

- MDN Web Docs - <nav> element. This helped me understand the best use cases for the <nav> tag.
- CSS Tricks - Styling Links. Great refresher on controlling link states and removing underlines.
